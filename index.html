                <h3>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
				<p><img  src="img/Tim.jpg"></p>
                <p>In 1989 the world wide web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was trying to find a new way for scientists to easily share the data from their experiments. 
			 In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN. 
			 <q>Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document 
			 you could skip to them with a click of the mouse.</q> Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext, a term 
			 that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, 
			 speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use the term hypermedia.</p>
			 <p>With help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a <q>Hypertext project</q> 
			 called <q>WorldWideWeb</q> (one word) as a <q>web</q> of <q>hypertext documents</q> to be viewed by <q>browsers</q> using a client&#8208;server architecture. At this point 
			 HTML and HTTP had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test. This proposal 
			 estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve <q>the creation of new links and new material by readers, 
			 so that authorship becomes universal</q> as well as <q>the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him/her has become available.</q> Tim also wrote the 
			 first web page editor/browser (<q>WorldWideWeb.app</q>) and the first web server (<q>httpd</q>). By the end of 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet, and 
			 in 1991, people outside of CERN were invited to join this new web community. </p>

                <h3>Growth of the web</h3>
            <p>Early adopters of the World Wide Web were primarily university-based scientific departments or physics laboratories such as Fermilab and SLAC. By January 1993 there were fifty 
			Web servers across the world; by October 1993 there were over five hundred. Initially, a web browser was available only for the NeXT operating system. This shortcoming was discussed 
			in January 1992, and alleviated in April 1992 by the release of Erwise, an application developed at the Helsinki University of Technology, and in May by ViolaWWW, created by 
			Pei-Yuan Wei, which included advanced features such as embedded graphics, scripting, and animation. Both programs ran on the X Window System for Unix.</p>
			<p>The first Microsoft Windows browser was Cello, written by Thomas R. Bruce for the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School to provide legal information, since access to 
			Windows was more widespread amongst lawyers than access to Unix. Cello was released in June 1993.</p>
			<p>The Web was first popularized by Mosaic, a graphical browser launched in 1993 by Marc Andreessen's team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the 
			University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The origins of Mosaic date to 1992.  In December 1992, Andreessen and Eric Bina, students attending UIUC and working at the NCSA,
			began work on Mosaic with funding from the High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative, a US-federal research and development program. Andreessen and Bina released a 
			Unix version of the browser in February 1993. Mac and Windows versions followed in August 1993. The browser gained popularity due to its strong support of integrated multimedia, 
			and the authors’ rapid response to user bug reports and recommendations for new features.</p>
			<p>In May 1994, the first International WWW Conference, organized by Robert Cailliau, was held at CERN. The conference has been held every year since. In April 1993, 
			CERN had agreed that anyone could use the Web protocol and code royalty-free. This was in part a reaction to the perturbation caused by the University of Minnesota's announcement 
			that it would begin charging license fees for its implementation of the Gopher protocol.</p>
			<p>In September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support from the Defense Advanced Research 
			Projects Agency (DARPA) and the European Commission. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web.
			Berners-Lee made the Web available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The W3C decided that its standards must be based on royalty-free technology, so they can be easily 
			adopted by anyone.</p>

                <h4>Dot Com Boom</h4>
            <p>Low interest rates in 1998&#8208;99 facilitated an increase in start-up companies. Although a number of these new entrepreneurs had realistic plans and administrative ability, most of 
			them lacked these characteristics but were able to sell their ideas to investors because of the novelty of the dot-com concept. Historically, the dot-com boom can be seen as similar
			to a number of other technology-inspired booms of the past including railroads in the 1840s, automobiles in the early 20th century, radio in the 1920s, television in the 1940s, 
			transistor electronics in the 1950s, computer time-sharing in the 1960s, and home computers and biotechnology in the 1980s.  Investors started throwing money at anything related 
			to the web; in many cases, if a company was seen to be on the web, then their stock prices would shoot up. This was known as the internet boom which marked the commercial growth 
			of the Internet since the advent of the World Wide Web.</p>
			<p>However, as more and more money was pumped into these startups, lots of investors overlooked basic business fundamentals and instead focussed their confidence on the advancements 
			in technology in the hope that they would one day see a return on their investments. Many companies which began as online retailers blossomed and became highly profitable. 
			More conventional retailers found online merchandising to be a profitable additional source of revenue. While some online entertainment and news outlets failed when their 
			seed capital ran out, others persisted and eventually became economically self-sufficient. Traditional media outlets (newspaper publishers, broadcasters and cablecasters in particular)
			also found the Web to be a useful and profitable additional channel for content distribution, and an additional means to generate advertising revenue. The sites that survived and 
			eventually prospered after the bubble burst had two things in common; a sound business plan, and a niche in the marketplace that was, if not unique, particularly well-defined and 
			well-served.</p>

                <h3>The web today</h3>
           <b><p>In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, telecommunications companies had a great deal of overcapacity as many Internet business clients went bust. That, plus ongoing investment 
			in local cell infrastructure kept connectivity charges low, helped to make high-speed Internet connectivity more affordable. During this time, a handful of companies found success
			developing business models that helped make the World Wide Web a more compelling experience. These include airline booking sites, Google's search engine and its profitable approach
			to keyword-based advertising, as well as eBay's auction site and Amazon.com's online department store.</p>
			<p>This new era also begot social networking websites, such as MySpace and Facebook, which gained acceptance rapidly and became a central part of youth culture. If any social networking
			website has revolutionised the way that we socially interact on the web, that accolade has to go to Facebook. Facebook managed to set itself apart from its competitors by coming up with
			innovative features and executing smart business decisions. One of those smart business moves is one that is also shared by Twitter; that is the offering of an API which allows other 
			developers to extend the sites' functionality and create apps that support the platforms. Decisions like this allowed the social web to become a major milestone in the history of 
			the World Wide Web.</p>
			<p>Beginning in 2002, new ideas for sharing and exchanging content ad hoc, such as Weblogs and RSS, rapidly gained acceptance on the Web. This new model for information exchange, 
			primarily featuring user-generated and user-edited websites, was dubbed Web 2.0. The Web 2.0 boom saw many new service-oriented startups catering to a newly democratized Web.
			As the Web became easier to query, it attained a greater ease of use overall and gained a sense of organization which ushered in a period of rapid popularization. Many new 
			sites such as Wikipedia and its sister projects were based on the concept of user edited content. In 2005, three former PayPal employees created a video viewing website 
			called YouTube, which became popular quickly and introduced a new concept of user-submitted content in major events. The popularity of YouTube, Facebook, etc., combined 
			with the increasing availability and affordability of high-speed connections has made video content far more common on all kinds of websites. Many video-content hosting 
			and creation sites provide an easy means for their videos to be embedded on third party websites without payment or permission.</p>
			<p>This combination of more user-created or edited content, and easy means of sharing content, such as via RSS widgets and video embedding, has led to many sites with a 
			typical "Web 2.0" feel. They have articles with embedded video, user-submitted comments below the article, and RSS boxes to the side, listing some of the latest articles 
			from other sites. Continued extension of the Web has focused on connecting devices to the Internet, coined Intelligent Device Management. As Internet connectivity becomes 
			ubiquitous, manufacturers have started to leverage the expanded computing power of their devices to enhance their usability and capability. Through Internet connectivity, 
			manufacturers are now able to interact with the devices they have sold and shipped to their customers, and customers are able to interact with the manufacturer (and other providers)
			to access new content.</p></b>
